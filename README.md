## Introduction

Laravel Love simplify management of Eloquent model's likes & dislikes. Make any model `likeable` & `dislikeable` in a minutes!

This package is a fork of the abandoned [Laravel Likeable](https://github.com/cybercog/laravel-likeable).
It completely changes package namespace architecture, aimed to API refactoring and adding new features.

## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer.

```sh
$ composer require cybercog/laravel-love
```

## Extending

You can override core classes of package with your own implementations:

- `Cog\Laravel\Love\Like\Models\Like`
- `Cog\Laravel\Love\LikeCounter\Models\LikeCounter`
- `Cog\Laravel\Love\Likeable\Services\LikeableService`

*Note: Don't forget that all custom models must implement original models interfaces.*

To make it you should use container [binding interfaces to implementations](https://laravel.com/docs/master/container#binding-interfaces-to-implementations) in your application service providers.

##### Use model class own implementation

```php
$this->app->bind(
    \Cog\Contracts\Love\Like\Models\Like::class,
    \App\Models\CustomLike::class
);
```

##### Use service class own implementation

```php
$this->app->singleton(
    \Cog\Contracts\Love\Likeable\Services\LikeableService::class,
    \App\Services\CustomService::class
);
```

After that your `CustomLike` and `CustomService` classes will be instantiable with helper method `app()`.

```php
$model = app(\Cog\Contracts\Love\Like\Models\Like::class);
$service = app(\Cog\Contracts\Love\Likeable\Services\LikeableService::class);
```
